@RequestMapping vs @GetMapping


@Controller vs @RestController:

	@Controller requires @ResponsyBody!

	@RestController ->  The controller is annotated with the @RestController annotation; therefore, the @ResponseBody isn't required.
	Every request handling method of the controller class automatically serializes return objects into HttpResponse.
